{ pkgs, pipe }:
# execline is a small utility which can be used as a general-purpose
# way of executing a command from a script without requiring a full
# posix shell.
#
# Its syntax is also dead-simple, so we can generate execline scripts
# from a nix list of strings and escape everything correctly, no further
# caution required on the programmer’s side.
#
# The main function here is `writeExecline`, which works like the
# functions in `pkgs.writers`.
#
# Documentation for execline is at
# http://skarnet.org/software/execline/index.html
# or in `pkgs.execline.doc`.
